DFT optimized structures of ternary cation perovskites

This repository is for sharing structural representations of FA<sub>x</sub>MA<sub>y</sub>Cs<sub>1-x-y</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskites. 
Each structure is a 2x2x2 supercell representation containing 8 cations. The 8 cations were substituted to achieve specific x,y values which fully swept the composition space resulting in 45 structures for each of cubic (corner-sharing), hexagonal (face-sharing), and orthorhombic (edge-sharing). The structures were optimized using the Vienna Ab initio Software Package (VASP). Each structure is given in VASP's POSCAR/CONTCAR format which can be read by many crystallographic tools. Some tools only recognize the files if they are give a .vasp extension.
